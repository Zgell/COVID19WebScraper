# COVID19WebScraper
A quick web scraper I wrote to pull COVID-19 information in real-time.

This project primarily served as an excuse to sit down and learn a bit about Python's web features. Specifically, web scraping and automation. I wrote this sometime in the first 2 months of the global COVID-19 pandemic, and with all of the sites popping up that tracked the number of cases in real time, I thought it would be interesting if I wrote a web scraper that could give me those stats in real-time without having to open my browser. This program is the result of that interest.
